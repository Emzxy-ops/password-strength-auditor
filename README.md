# 🔒 Password Strength Auditor

## Overview
A Python-based security tool designed to audit password complexity against standard cybersecurity policies (NIST guidelines). This tool helps users identify weak credentials that are vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## Features
- **Length Verification:** Enforces minimum character requirements (8+) to increase entropy.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Scans for Uppercase, Lowercase, Numeric, and Special characters.
- **Security Reporting:** Provides actionable feedback on specific vulnerabilities found in the password.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Scripting:** String manipulation and conditional logic.
- **Security Compliance:** Implementing logic based on strong password policies.
- **Input Validation:** Handling user input securely.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 password_auditor.py
 ### **Step 2: Save the File**
Press **`Ctrl` + `S`** to save the file.

### **Step 3: The "Update" Commit**
Because you changed the file *after* your first commit, Git sees this as a "modification." We need to save this new version.

Go to your terminal (it should still be open) and run these two commands:

1.  **Stage the change:**
    ```powershell
    git add .
    ```
2.  **Save the update:**
    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Added documentation to README"
    ```

**Tell me when you see the success message (it should say `1 file changed`).**
Then we will add the final "Hidden Input" security feature to the Python code before we push everything to the cloud!
